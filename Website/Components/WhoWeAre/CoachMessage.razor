    <h2>A Message from Coach Chris</h2>
    <p>As the head coach of the Trailcats, I’m committed to helping young riders build confidence, skills, and friendships. Mountain biking has been a lifelong passion of mine, and I’m excited to pass on that love of the sport. Our team is all about pushing boundaries, respecting nature, and enjoying the journey. Welcome to the Trailcats family!</p>
